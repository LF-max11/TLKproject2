Create a set called colors containing four colors: 'red', 'blue', 'green', and 'yellow'.
Begin a loop that will iterate through each element in the colors set.
For each iteration, store the current color in a variable called color.
Print the value stored in color. 
Continue iterating until all colors have been printed.
