Start 

Randomly pick a number between 1 and 10.

Ask the user to guess the number.

Get the user's input and store it in the guess variable.

Use a loop to keep asking the user to guess until they get it right.

If the guess is correct, display a success message and break out of the loop.

Display a message that the guess was wrong and prompt the user to try again.

The loop ends when the user guesses correctly.
